# MarkovModelSamples

Here is a collection of JSON files for use in "Markov Model Simulator"

### To load a model into "Markov Model Simulator":

- Download a file from this GitHub and save it in a location you will remember.
- Navigate to the tool and in the top right corner there is a "Load" button.
- Click this and select the JSON file you just downloaded.

### Common errors

- Be careful if you modify the JSON, this may make the file unreadable or introduce errors to the models.
- If the file isn't loading clear the canvas with the "clear" button in the top right and try again.
